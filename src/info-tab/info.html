                <p>
                    The Topics API serves as a Privacy Sandbox feature crafted to safeguard privacy while enabling
                    browsers to communicate user interest information with third parties. This facilitates
                    interest-based advertising (IBA) without the need to track the specific websites visited by a user.
                    IBA is a type of tailored advertising wherein an advertisement is chosen for a user according to
                    their interests, deduced from the websites they have recently accessed. This differs from contextual
                    advertising, which tries to match ads with the content on the page the user is currently viewing.

                <p>
                    The Topics API Catcher extension was developed to provide transparency about which websites are
                    using the Topics API. It injects scripts into web pages to intercept calls to the `browsingTopics`
                    function, logging details about the calls such as arguments, return values, and the source of the
                    call. Users can view this information, allowing them to understand how their browsing activity is
                    being tracked and managed.
